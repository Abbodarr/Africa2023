Although the neighborhood was occupied by \"Africans and coloreds\" (still terms used by South Africans today), they were not allowed to own property under Apartheid.  Instead, they leased the houses from white landlords. When the people who lived here were finally allowed to purchase property, they painted the houses bright colors as an expression of their freedom. The houses are repainted regularly, still with bright, vibrant colors.",
