Although the neighborhood was occupied by what was called \"Africans and coloreds\" (and it the terms still used by South Africans to this day), what we would call \"black and brown people\", they were not allowed to own property under Apartheid so leased the houses from white landlords. When the people who lived here were finally allowed to purchase property, then painted the houses bright colors as an expression of their freedom. The houses are repainted regularly, and are still painted in bright vibrant colors."
